This scene demonstrates a small interactive physics-based bowling game built in Babylon.js.
It includes:

A player character (Farmer model) with idle and walking animations, controlled through the keyboard.
Three bowling lanes, each with wooden textures, a differently colored bowling ball, and a full set of physics-enabled pins.
Fully functional Havok physics: balls roll, pins collide, fall naturally, and interact with walls.
A GUI interface showing collision debug information and a Restart Scene button.
A surrounding environment with skybox and decorative trees to make the scene feel complete.
Proper collision boundaries preventing the player, balls, and pins from leaving the play area.
Overall, the project demonstrates character control, animation handling, physics interactions, environmental design, and GUI integration.
